# Find-Target-Element-Using-Binary-Search
Given a sorted array of integers and a target value, write a function to find the target value's index using the binary search algorithm. If the target value does not exist in the array, return -1. Binary search reduces the search space by half in each step, making it efficient for sorted datasets.
